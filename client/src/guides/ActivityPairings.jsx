          <h1>Activity Pairings</h1>

          <p>As an Ultimate Ironperson, preparing your inventory for an activity takes time, so there is a cost switching activities. This guide is to note some of my favorite activity pairings that can be done with mostly the same inventory.</p>

          <h2>
            Guardians of the Rift and mining stars
          </h2>

          <p>
            Since Guardians of the Rift requires a pickaxe and leaves you with a mostly empty inventory (after deathbanking), an AFK activity to pair with it is mining stars. The celestial ring which allows mining essence faster in Guardians of the Rift is charged with stardust from mining stars, so if you are doing GOTR for a long time this will allow you to recharge your ring.

          <h2>
            The Mess and woodcutting/fletching
          </h2>

          <p>
            The Mess is quite an intense training method in Kourend that is best done with just a knife in your inventory (and rune pouch) so a good AFK activity to pair with it is woodcutting/fletching at the Woodcutting guild.
