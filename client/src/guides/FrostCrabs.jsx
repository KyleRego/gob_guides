        <p>
            Frost crabs are good AFK magic training due to their elemental weakness to fire. This is a good place to burn excess chaos runes from Guardians of The Rift or Barrows, but even fire strike is viable for decent experience rates in a pinch. After completion of The Heart of Darkness they can be found in the Ruins of Tapoyauik.
